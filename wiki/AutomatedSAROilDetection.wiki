= Technical Details and Examples =

This project is aimed at detecting oil slick on the ocean surface imaged by space-borne radar sensors.  Image processing techniques such as low-pass filtering, morphological operations and adaptive thresholding are being used to isolate dark pixels that characterize oil contaminated waters from the background ocean clutter.

The thresholding technique includes clutter modeling and image statistic parameter estimation for image segmentation.

 * Expected applications
  * Marine environmental monitoring
  * Maritime security and safety
