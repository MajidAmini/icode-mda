The International Collaborative Development of Open Source Tools for Enhanced MDA is a program aimed at developing enhanced global maritime domain awareness via two components:
  # A global community of open source algorithm and tool developers.
  # A web-portal which allows users from all nations to visualize and share data, share analysis, and communicate to achieve enhanced MDA. 

This wiki contains material from the course taught in Chile.

= Getting Started =
After you have looked through the lessons, or if you are already familiar with the material, you are ready to start developing applications. For more information on how to develop your own applications and contribute to the community, check out the [GettingStarted Getting Started with OSSIM/OpenCV] page.

If you're primarily interested in web-portal development, you should check out our [GettingStartedOMAR Getting Started with OMAR] page. It has information on how to get the development environment setup and how to extend OMAR.

to see a list of research ideas that we are interested in researching, check out the [ProjectIdeas Project Ideas page].
