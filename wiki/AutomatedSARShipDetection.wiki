#summary Automated SAR Ship Detection Tool Development Page.

= Introduction =

This page describes current development of the Automated SAR Ship Detection tool for ICODE-MDA, including who is developing the tool, it's status, and technical details with examples.

= Tool Developers =
 * Michael Agbo Tettey Soli
 * Kwame Agyekum
 * Brian Salmon
 * Waldo Kleynhans

= Current Status of Tool =  

Michael has developed OSSIM C++ code to read in satellite images and
tile it according to the user specific dimensions and convert it to an
IPL image for Kwame’s ship detection algorithm to be applied on the IPL
images. He has packaged this into a header file that can be used easily.
He is currently working on modularizing Kwame’s ship detection code into
functions that can be called at various stages for defined purposes.

Brian and Waldo are developing OSSIM C++ code that can be used to detect ships. The source code is currently being packaged into functions that can easily be accessed by including the header file. They are also in the process of creating a scholarship program dedicated to this project that will be funded by  [http://www.armscor.co.za/ Armscor] and [http://www.csir.co.za/ CSIR].
