==Ship Detection in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Imagery==
Synthetic aperture radar is an active radar (radiates energy, and observes the reflections) that many people are interested in using for ship detection. The basic idea is that there are generally not many objects in the ocean that reflect the energy emitted by the radar. A ship on the other hand, with its many corners and metal construction can reflect a large amount of the energy emitted. This makes ships stand out very brightly against the dark ocean background.

To learn some of the basics of SAR, you can start here:<br>

A breif overview of the mathematics behind SAR ship detection can be found here:<br>

==Data Correlation and Tracking==
When dealing with large amounts of information from multiple sensors it can become very difficult to interpret it all and to take away useful information. There is research being done to come up with new methods for taking the information from each sensor and associating it with information from other sensors to gain a more complete understanding of the environment. If you have read through the material on this site, one example that you should be familiar with is correlating AIS information with SAR ship detection information. 



There are two components to the problem.  
  # Creating and maintaining tracks from data points.
  # Fusing tracks and/or data points from several data sources.

  * Algorithms for matching vectors.  

We can think of two distinct sets of data as two sets of vectors

[ lat lon length width heading ....]

To correlate data set 1 with data set 2, we need to find the best match between each of the vectors in data set 1 with all of the vectors in data set 2.

OpenCV has many algorithms for matching vectors.  Although they are used in OpenCV for matching image feature vectors, they can also be used to match data vectors.  

http://opencv.itseez.com/modules/features2d/doc/common_interfaces_of_descriptor_matchers.html 

Data matching algorithms in *OpenCV*:

*KNN Matching* - Finds the k best matches for each descriptor from a query set.
*Brute Force* - For each descriptor in the first set, this matcher finds the closest descriptor in the second set by trying each one


==Ocean Surface Analysis (Oil slick detection, Ocean current detection/analysis)==
There are many reasons why someone may want to analyze the surface of the ocean such as:

  * Inputs to weather models
  * Detect/Predict arrival of hazardous waste
  * Mission planning

There is active research being conducted aimed at drawing conclusions about the surface of the ocean. The research spans many technologies such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_aperture_radar SAR], Electo-optical, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multispectral_imaging Multispectral] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspectral_imaging Hyperspectral]. More generally, using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing Remote Sensing].

==Vessel Detection/Classification from Hyperspectral and Multispectral data==
There is interest detecting and classifying vessels based on remotely sensed data. Researchers are interested in using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspectral hyper-spectral imaging] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multispectral multi-spectral imaging] to identify and classify objects. These hyper/multi-spectral imaging lends itself to the identification/classification task because these images have information about many frequencies of light for each pixel. Research is being done to discover methods which tease out patterns and important information from the data.

Because the objects that are searched for are generally assumed to be anomalous from the background in some way, much of the research is focused on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection Anomaly Detection] (e.g. RX anomaly detection). Another main branch of research is in spectral classification methods which aims to classify data based on its spectral profile.

==High performance computing + Hyperspectral imagery processing==
Remotely sensed images tend to be very large (~ Gigabytes) and can take a long time to analyze with typical computers. Within the last few years [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPU GPUs] have been increasingly used for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gpu_computing General Purpose computing on a GPU]. The GPUs allow conventional desktops to behave similar to a mini-super computer because of their many parallel processing units. Many algorithms used for remote sensing have the ability to become parallelized. Research is being done to create efficient GPGPU implementations of old algorithms and also to develop new ones.

==Algae Bloom Detection Using Remotely Sensed Data==
An [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae_bloom algae bloom] happens when an algae population grows very rapidly. Large algae blooms can be detected from space using remotely sensed data. Some algae blooms are known to be harmful, while others are not. Detecting an algae bloom can give you information about nutrient levels and danger to other aquatic species.

==Vessel Track Anomaly Detection and Position Prediction==

The idea here is to take historical tracks of all vessels as derived from for example AIS or coastal radar, as well as models for vessel behavior and detect the presence of a kinematic anomalies.  In addition, using models for vessel movement and behavior, be able to predict the most likely position of a vessel in the future or based on the last received position.  Predicted positions should have confidence associated with them.

==Vessel Information/Static Anomaly Detection==

Here, static information from a vessel is used to identify anomalies or high risk vessels.  This information may come from a variety of sources;
i)  AIS static information like vessel name, MMSI, IMO, type, activity, cargo
ii)  Open source information from sites like vesseltracker.com
iii) Loyd's Fairplay data, which contains vessel owner, crew, cargo, and destination information.
These algorithms/tools should recognize unusual or high risk information for vessels.

==Small Vessel Detection in Coastal Radar Data==
Here, the goal is to take raw radar data and detect and track small vessels, which may otherwise be lost in traditional radar processing.
