#summary Anomaly Detection with Markov Random Fields in Surveillance Applications Page.

= Introduction =

This page describes current development of the Anomaly Detection for Maritime Security tool for ICODE-MDA, including who is developing the tool, it's status, and technical details with examples.

= Tool Developer =

Joel Dabrowski

= Background and Application =

In the efforts of maintaining maritime security, maritime surveillance is essential. Electronic surveillance is a tool that can be utilized to  survey  the  maritime  domain.  With  the  vast  spatial  range  of  the  oceans  and  shorelines,  electronic surveillance provides a large set of data. This set of data is too large for a human analyst or operator to efÔ¨Åciently observe for the purpose of maritime vessel control and monitoring. Automatic maritime domain awareness systems provide a means for machines to analyse and interpret electronic surveillance data. The purpose of this tool is to provide such a system; one that is able to analyse and detect illegal activity.

= Applications =

Applications for the tool include:
 * Piracy
 * Smuggling
 * Illegal immigration.

= Simulation =

The tool shall be tested using an agent based simulation environment. The simulation environment may be configured over a particular region with a set of vessels that operate within the region. Each of the vessel's behaviour is simulated using a finite state machine.

= Anomaly Detection=

The environment shall be modelled using a probabilistic graphical model. In particular the Markov Random Field is of interest. The model will provide a means for a classification based anomaly detection algorithm to be implemented. This algorithm will have the purpose of detecting illegal activities.

= Current Status = 

Currently the simulation environment is being developed in MATLAB. Path planning, vessel motion and basic finite state machines have been implemented.

The following image is a time slice of a simulation in progress for pirate activity. The cargo vessels (yellow) are simulated to follow paths between specified harbour points. The pirate agents (red) attempt to ambush and attack cargo vessels. Once a cargo vessel has been hijacked, the pirate returns to a home base (1).
