#summary Deploying OMAR war file into tomcat

= Introduction =

Deployment is the term used for the process of installing a web application (either a 3rd party WAR or your own custom web application) into the Tomcat server. The following are instructions on deploying your OMAR War file. 


= Details =
 # Installation
  # Development computer : Computer where OMAR was built
   # Configuration: Make sure your $OMAR_HOME/grails-app/conf/DataSource.groovy Production configuration is setup for you target computer (Username, Password, etc)
   # Create WAR File: From a working OMAR development project do the following:
{{{
cd $OMAR_HOME
grails prod war omar.war
}}}
   # Make a data dump of your database
   {{{
pg_dump -U postgres --column-inserts --data-only --disable-triggers -f omarData.sql omardb-1.8.14-prod 
   }}}
   # Take the following to the Target computer
    ** $OMAR_HOME/ddl.sql
    ** $OMAR_HOME/geoms.sql
    ** $OMAR_HOME/omar.war
    ** omarData.sql
    ** All libs, unless target computer is different then the development computer.  In that case all the libs will need to be built on the target computer. 
  # Server Computer : Computer where OMAR will be deployed to
   # Install Java.  Make sure the same java version and java bit size is installed that was used on your development computer.  
   # Install PostgreSQl / PostGIS: http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
    ** Use default Port 5432
    ** Run Stack Builder to load additional software
    ** Install PostGIS 2.0
    ** Define the environment variable POSTGIS_HOME = "GIS Installed directory"
    ** Create a GIS database that was specified on your DataSource.groovy file (IE:  omardb-1.8.14-prod). If using pgAdmin, specify the "template_postgis" Template under the Definition tab.
    ** Run the ddl.sql script on your database
    ** Run the geoms.sql script on your database
    ** Run the omarData.sql on your database
   # Install Tomcat http://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html
   # Install OSSIM LIBS
   ** Make sure all OSSIM libs are located at $OSSIM_INSTALL_PREFIX 
   ** Add $OSSIM_INSTALL_PREFIX to your PATH environment variable
 # Launch OMAR application
  # Copy your WAR file to the tomcat "webapps" folder 
  # Start Tomcat
  # Point your web browser to : http://localhost:8080/omar



=Trouble Shooting=

 # I'm getting the following error message:
{{{
"java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.hibernatespatial.postgis.PostgisDialect"
}}}
Your WAR is missing postgis plugin.  This tends to happen now and again and should be fixed with the integration to Grails 2.0.
To fix it do the following:
{{{
cd $OMAR_DEV_HOME/plugins/postgis
grails clean
grails package-plugin
cd $OMAR_HOME
grails clean
grails prod war omar.war
}}}
 # On Windows target machine, I'm getting the following
{{{
Native code library failed to load.
}}}
 You probably need Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package installed
Here is the 2010 Version. Download the version you used to build it with.
