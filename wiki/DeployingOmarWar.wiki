   # Create WAR File: From a working OMAR development project do the following:
{{{
cd $OMAR_HOME
grails prod war omar.war
}}}
  # Server Computer : Computer where OMAR will be deployed to
   # Install Java.  Make sure the same java version and java bit size is installed that was used on your development computer.  
   # Install PostgreSQl / PostGIS: http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/
    ** Use default Port 5432
    ** Run Stack Builder to load additional software
    ** Install PostGIS 2.0
    ** Define the environment variable POSTGIS_HOME = "GIS Installed directory"

 # Launch OMAR application

=Trouble Shooting=
 # I'm getting the following error message:
{{{
"java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org.hibernatespatial.postgis.PostgisDialect"
}}}
 Your WAR is missing postgis plugin.  This tends to happen now and again and should be fixed with the integration to Grails 2.0.
 To fix it do the following:
 {{{
cd $OMAR_HOME
grails clean
grails prod war omar.war
}}}
