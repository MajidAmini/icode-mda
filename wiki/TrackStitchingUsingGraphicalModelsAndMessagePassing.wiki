#summary This page describes the project titled Track Stitching Using Graphical Models and Message Passing tool.

= Short description =
Track stitching has become a prominent part of modern tracking systems. Unfortunately the amount of data associations grow exponentially with the number of targets, thereby leading to a scaling problem in cluttered environments.

In this project a graphical model is proposed to model the tracklets as nodes. It is proposed that local messages are passed between neighboring nodes to reduce the computational overhead.
