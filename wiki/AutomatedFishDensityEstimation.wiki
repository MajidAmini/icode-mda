Kwame is a PhD student at the Department of Oceanography & Fisheries of the University of Ghana.  He is currently using multispectral ocean colour and sea surface temperature dataset in understanding biological production in the Guinea Current Large Marine Ecosystem.  

Kwame also has interest in using various satellite imageries including high resolution optical and synthetic aperture radar data for marine domain awareness activities especially to help regulate illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing activities off the coast of Ghana


= Technical Details and Examples =

Using SST data, we are developing techniques for automatic detection of persistent fronts and verify any relationship with tuna catch distribution in the Gulf of Guinea.  Our approach involves using gradient and histogram based techniques, and a test of bimodality to detect edges within the ocean surface with warm and cold water masses.   To better understand thermal preference of tuna in the eastern equatorial Atlantic, we also identify the warm and cold side of detected fronts and generate a matrix of proximity of catch to fronts, sea surface thermal preference and a preference of warm or cold side of fronts of tuna.  Our preliminary analyses show the three dominant tuna species in the Gulf of Guinea i.e. Yellow fin, Bigeye and Skipjack, abundance decrease away from fronts, with large tuna catch near fronts associated with temperatures between 26 – 28˚C.

  * Fisheries management

  * Identifying potential fishing zones for tuna
